The ultimate goal is to simplify gathering and crafting daily turnins by
optimising for distance travelled

I shouldn't be zigzagging across Eorzea because the crafting materials list was
sorted alphabetically instead of optimised for minimum distance travelled

# TODO

- Gather data from xivdb
    - Cache them in some local database format to prevent spurious accesses
- Take in gathering requirements and crafting requirements
- Decompose them into a list of materials
- Figure out how to collect all the materials using a least-distance route
